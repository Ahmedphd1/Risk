// ---- Position and localposition --------- //

** localposition **
1. localposition is taking into account the relative coordinates of the parent object
2. for example using localposition on child objects will place the object relative to its parent object

** position **
1. position is taking into account the world coordinates.
2. so the whole scene coordinates is the world position.

-- conclusion --

use "Localposition" when trying to place child objects

use "position" when placing scene objects
